## xtendedMap for Vintage Story

A total rewrite of the ZigTheHedge WorldMapMaster mod

__What does this mod do?__
- creates a convenient list for switching between waypoints
- sort waypoints by *name*, *distance* to player, and creation *time*

in future:
- selecting pinned/unpinned waypoints
- replacing/modification of vanilla world map
- compass HUD
-
